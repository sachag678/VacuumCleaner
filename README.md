# VacuumCleaner

Contains the different Vaccum cleaner agents, maps and ability to build traces of the agents traversing on the maps. 

The code was originally built by the authors for experiments done in: Ontañón, S., Montaña, J. L., & Gonzalez, A. J. (2014). A Dynamic-Bayesian Network framework for modeling and evaluating learning from observation. Expert Systems with Applications, 41(11), 5212–5226. http://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2014.02.049

It has been modified by separating the Learning from Observation framework from the Vacuum cleaner domain. 

New agents and maps have benn added.
